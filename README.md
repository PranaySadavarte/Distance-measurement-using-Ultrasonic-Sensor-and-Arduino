# Distance-measurement-using-Ultrasonic-Sensor-and-Arduino
•	An Ultrasonic sensor and a 16X2 LCD display were interfaced using Arduino Uno R3 Microcontroller to measure the distance from the sensor to an obstacle placed in front of it.
•	The LiquidCrystal.h library was used to calibrate the LCD Screen and the distance was measured in cm.
•	In case of an unavailability of LCD display, a Serial Monitor program was made to display the distance on the Arduino IDE using a USB connector.
